###Template Engines##
It helps us in generating dynamic html content by combining HTML Templats with data from
there are various template engines like (hbs,ejs,pug)
To use template engine we first have to create a view folder in a dir 
then in that we have to make a index.(hbs/ejs/pug)
and copy the dynamic html we want to serve on our website.
In node application we simply create a template engine and then
app.set("view engine", "ejs/hbs/pug")
app.get("",(req,res) => {
    res.render("index")
});
